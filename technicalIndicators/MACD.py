'''
Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum
indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a
security’s price

Basic idea:
    1) Compute a fast exponential moving average (EMA) of asset's close price
    2) Compute a slow exponential moving average of asset's close price
    3) Define the MACD line as the fast EMA minus the slow EMA
    4) Define the signal line as the (fastest) signal EMA of the MACD line

Traders may buy the security when the MACD crosses above its signal line and
sell (short) the security when the MACD crosses below the signal line

    Parameters
    ----------
    ohlcv : Dataframe
        Contains the open, high, low, close and volume information for an asset
            Must contain a column called 'Adj Close'
    fastEMA : int
        Number of periods for fast exponential moving average of close price
            Typical value = 12 periods
    slowEMA : int
        Number of periods for slow exponential moving average of close price
            Typical value = 26 periods
    signalEMA : int
        Number of periods for exponential moving average of the MACD line
            Typical value = 9 periods
    fullReturn : str
        If not nil then return the dataframe with the fast and slow EMAs

    Returns
    -------
    macd : Dataframe
        Contains the MACD line
    signal: Dataframe
        Contains the signal line
