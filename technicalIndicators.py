# %% 1. Average True Range (ATR)

'''
Average true range (ATR) is a measure of market volatility

The true range indicator is taken as the max of the following:
    1) Current high less the current low
    2) The absolute value of the current high less the previous close
    3) The absolute value of the current low less the previous close
The average true range (ATR) is then a moving average of the true ranges

Traders may buy the security when the MACD crosses above its signal line and
sell (short) the security when the MACD crosses below the signal line

# %% 2. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)


'''
Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum
indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a
securityâ€™s price

Basic idea:
    1) Compute a fast exponential moving average (EMA) of asset's close price
    2) Compute a slow exponential moving average of asset's close price
    3) Define the MACD line as the fast EMA minus the slow EMA
    4) Define the signal line as the (fastest) signal EMA of the MACD line

Traders may buy the security when the MACD crosses above its signal line and
sell (short) the security when the MACD crosses below the signal line

'''
Average Directional Indicator is a measure of the strength of a trend.

Value ranges between 0 and 100, with the following rough distinctions:

    51 - 75 = Very strong trend
    76 - 100 =  Extremely strong trend

by a support from below and the resistance level above.
